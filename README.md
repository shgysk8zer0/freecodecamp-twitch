FreeCodeCamp: Use the Twitchtv JSON API

- - -

1. [ ] Objective: Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/) app that is
functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/
2. [ ] Fulfill the below [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story).
Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
3. [ ] **User Story**: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
4. [ ] **User Story**: I can click the status output and be sent directly to
the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
5. [ ] **User Story**: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional
details about what they are streaming.
6. [ ] **Hint**: See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541.
7. [ ] **Hint**: The relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/streams/#get-stream-by-user.
8. [ ] **Hint**: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream:
`["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]`
9. [ ] **UPDATE**: Due to a change in conditions on API usage explained here
Twitch.tv now requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use
https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api instead of twitch's API base URL
(i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/kraken ) and you'll still be able to get account
information, without needing to sign up for an API key.
10. [ ] Remember to use [Read-Search-Ask](http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514)
if you get stuck.
11. [ ] When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and
include a link to your CodePen.
12. [ ] You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
